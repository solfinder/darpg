Citizens submit their concerns and grievances through the PGPORTAL. These grievances are assigned to the respective departments/state. This report analyzes the incoming grievances by their concerned department/state. It provides a perspective about the number of grievances being received for a particular agency over a period of time and helps determine if the department needs additional staffic or is overstaffed.
